# Animal Dog Breed Intelligence Size and Popularity

Dogs are said to be man’s best friend. Literally available in all shapes and sizes, dogs have been selectively bred into over 190 breeds today. However, not all breeds are favored equally and some are certainly more popular than others.

Why is that so, and can we use data to investigate this? The answer is yes, and you’ll be the one to do so!

Embark on an end-to-end data project with UpLevel to assess if there is a relationship between 

  1.  a breed’s intelligence with its size
  2.  a breed’s size with its popularity
  3.  a breed’s intelligence with its popularity
